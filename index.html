            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                pages that share the file and its formatting.
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
                type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
                validation service for CSS documents.[5]
                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and
                XUL.CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style
                properties
                A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and
                a declaration block.
                Selector
                "CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
                In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in
                the markup itself.
                Selectors may apply to the following:
                all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
                elements specified by attribute, in particular:
                id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g. #id
                class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a period prefix
                e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element
                classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is a feature of HTML that is distinct from the work on
                browsers' presentational styling subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles;
                see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)
                elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
                Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters,
                hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only
                be applied to a single element.
                Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained
                in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only
                when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is
                appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements,
                such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial
                elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6] Note the double-colon notation for pseudo-elements
                versus single-colon notation for pseudo-class.
                Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple
                selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or
                any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color:
                red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div
                {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be
                confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass {color: red;} which applies to div elements
                of class myClass.
                The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that
                introduced it.[8]
                A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of a
                property, a colon (:), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (;) must
                be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional semi-colon after the last (or single) declaration
                may be use
                Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some
                properties can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular groups of
                elements.[10][11]
                Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels),
                50vw (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width). Color values
                can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as
                #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that specify both color and
                alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000, 100%, 50%),
                hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%)).[12]
                Length units
                Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a length unit, which is either an
                alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in 200px or 50vw; or a percentage sign, as in 80%. Some units – cm
                (centimetre); in (inch); mm (millimetre); pc (pica); and pt (point) – are absolute, which means that the
                rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page; others – em (em); ex (ex) and px
                (pixel)[clarification needed] – are relative, which means that factors such as the font size of a parent
                element can affect threndered measurement. These eight units were a feature of CSS 1[13] and retained in
                all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 will, if adopted as a W3C
                Recommendation, provide seven further length units: ch; Q; rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and vw.[14]
                Use
                Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML
                markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly
                described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another
                file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler
                For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined
                structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these
                elements is presentational.
                Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2
                headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made
                documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the
                separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders,
                spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen
                and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text
                readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.[15]
                For example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as:
                Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational
                attributes:
                The advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the
                style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For
                example, suppose the document contains the style element:
                All h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code.
                If the author later wanted to make h1 elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style
                element to:
                rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual h1
                element.
                The styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax
                This further decouples the styling from the HTML document and makes it possible to restyle multiple
                documents by simply editing a shared external CSS file.
                Sources
                CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user,
                and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type,
                importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance, and property definition. CSS style
                information can be in a separate document, or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style
                sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for
                example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor
                the presentation appropriately for each medium.
                The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the
                highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style. The
                process is called cascading.
                One of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red
                italic headings difficult to read may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and the
                web site, a user may choose from various style sheets provided by the designers, or may remove all added
                styles and view the site using the browser's default styling, or may override just the red italic
                heading style without altering other attributes.nheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the
                ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are
                applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.[16] Inheritance relies on the
                document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements
                may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant
                elements inherit text-related properties, but their box-related properties are not inherited. Properties
                that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent,
                text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are
                background, border, display, float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width,
                outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.
                Inheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and over again in a style sheet,
                allowing for shorter CSS.
                Inheritance in CSS is not the same as inheritance in class-based programming languages, where it is
                possible to define class B as "like class A, but with modifications".[18] With CSS, it is possible to
                style an element with "class A, but with modifications". However, it is not possible to define a CSS
                class B like that, which could then be used to style multiple elements without
                Inline items are laid out in the same way as the letters in words in text, one after the other across
                the available space until there is no more room, then starting a new line below. Block items stack
                vertically, like paragraphs and like the items in a bulleted list. Normal flow also includes relative
                positioning of block or inline items, and run-in boxes.
                Floats
                A floated item is taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible in
                the space available. Other content then flows alongside the floated item.
                Absolute positioning
                An absolutely positioned item has no place in, and no effect on, the normal flow of other items. It
                occupies its assigned position in its container independently of other items.[20]
                Position property
                There are five possible values of the position property. If an item is positioned in any way other than
                static, then the further proerties top, bottom, left, and right are used to specify offsets and
                positions.The element having position static is not affected by the top, bottom , left or right
                properties
                Static
                The default value places the item in the normal flow
                Relative
                The item is placed in the normal flow, and then shifted or offset from that position. Subsequent flow
                items are laid out as if the item had not been moved.
                Absolute
                Specifies absolute positioning. The element is positioned in relation to its nearest non-static
                ancestor.
                Fixed
                The item is absolutely positioned in a fixed position on the screen even as the rest of the document is
                scrolled[20]
                Float and clear
                The float property may have one of three values. Absolutely positioned or fixed items cannot be floated.
                Other elements normally flow around floated items, unless they are prevented from doing so by their
                clear property
                left
                The item floats to the left of the line that it would have appeared in; other items may flow around its
                right side.
                right
                The item floats to the right of the line that it would have appeared in; other items may flow around its
                left side.
                clearvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvCSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[22] At the time, Lie
                was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[23] Several other style sheet languages for the web were
                proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web
                Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[24] being released in 1996. In
                particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as
                co-creator of CSS.[25
                Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup
                Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[26] One
                requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the
                web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other
                hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[26]
                As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web
                developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more
                complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[27] made
                consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The
                browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The
                style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[23] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN,
                wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe
                different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.[27]
                Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine
                different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list.[26] Of these nine
                proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[22] and
                Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).[25][28] Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial
                proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[29][30][31] Bert
                Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser.[25] Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to
                develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be
                applied to other markup languages besides HTML).[23]
                Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago,
                Illinois in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[23] Around this time the W3C was already being
                established, and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end
                chaired by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML
                editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the
                project, with additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In
                August 1996, Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called
                JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS).[23] The spec was never finished, and is deprecated.[32] By the end of
                1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.
                Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review
                Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: HTML Working group, chaired by
                Dan Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working group,
                chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C.
                The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in
                the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12,
                1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.
                In 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This
                meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3 Text were pulled back
                from Candidate Rec
                The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3[23] was released in that
                year, featuring some limited support for CSS. IE 4 and Netscape 4.x added more support, but it was
                typically incomplete and had many bugs that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than
                three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification. Internet
                Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March 2000, was the first browser to have full (better than
                99 percent) CSS 1 support,[33] surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS
                support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterward, and many of them additionally
                implemented parts of CSS 2.[citation needed]
                However, even when later "version 5" web browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS,
                they were still incorrect in certain areas and were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs and other quirks.
                Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x for Windows, as opposed to the very different IE for Macintosh, had a
                flawed implementation of the CSS box model, as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and
                variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across
                browsers and platforms without the use of workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters. The IE Windows box
                model bugs were so serious that, when Internet Explorer 6 was released, Microsoft introduced a
                backwards-compatible mode of CSS interpretation ("quirks mode") alongside an alternative, corrected
                "standards mode". Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided mode-switch capabilities. It therefore
                became necessary for authors of HTML files to ensure they contained special distinctive
                "standards-compliant CSS intended" marker to show that the authors intended CSS to be interpreted
                correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now long-obsolete
                IE5/Windows browser. Without this marker, web browsers that have the "quirks mode"-switching capability
                will size objects in web pages as IE 5 on Windows would, rather than following CSS standards.[citation
                needed]

                Problems with patchy adoption of CSS, along with errata in the original specification, led the W3C to
                revise the CSS 2 standard into CSS 2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support
                in HTML browsers. Some CSS 2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a
                few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing
                implementations. CSS 2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS 2.1 was pulled
                back to Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,[34] and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status
                on July 19, 2007.[35]
                In addition to these problems, the .css extension was used by a software product used to convert
                PowerPoint files into Compact Slide Show files,[36] so some web servers served all .css[37] as MIME type
                application/x-pointplus[38] rather than text/css.

                Vendor prefixes
                Individual browser vendors occasionally introduced new parameters ahead of standardization and
                universalization. To prevent interfering with future implementations, vendors prepended unique names to
                the parameters, such as -moz- for Mozilla Firefox, -webkit- named after the browsing engine of Apple
                Safari, -o- for Opera Browser and -ms- for Microsoft Internet Explorer and early versions of Microsoft
                Edge that use EdgeHTML.

                Occasionally, the parameters with vendor prefix such as -moz-radial-gradient and -webkit-linear-gradient
                have slightly different syntax as compared to their non-vendor-prefix counterparts.[39]

                Prefixed properties are rendered obsolete by the time of standardization. Programs are available to
                automatically add prefixes for older browsers, and to point out standardized versions of prefixed
                parameters. Since prefixes are limited to a small subset of browsers, removing the prefix allows other
                browsers to see the functionality. An exception is certain obsolete -webkit- prefixed properties, which
                are so common and persistent on the web that other families of browsers have decided to support them for
                compatibility.[40]

                VarCSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new
                features and typically denoted[citation needed] as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4. Profiles are
                typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface.
                Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets. Profiles should not be
                confused with media types, which were added in CSS 2.

                CSS 1
                The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on 17
                December 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers.[41][42] Among its
                capabilities are support for
                Font properties such as typeface and emphasis
                Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements
                Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text
                Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements
                Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
                Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes
                The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.[43
                CSS 2
                CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. A
                superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed
                positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which
                were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules)[44] and bidirectional text, and new font properties
                such as shadows.
                The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 recommendation.[45
                CSS 2.1
                CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported
                or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extnsions to the specification.
                To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth
                between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became a
                Candidate Recommendation on 25 February 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on 13 June 2005 for
                further review. It returned to Candidate Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009.
                However, because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last Call Working Draft on
                7 December 2010.
                CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011.[46] After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory
                Committee, it was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.[47
                CSS 2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2—but low priority work on CSS 2.2 began in
                2015.
                CSS 3
                "CSS3" redirects here. For other uses, see CSS3 (disambiguation).
                Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into
                several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features
                defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of
                publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June
                1999.[48
                Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses.[49]
                Some modules have Candidate Recommendation (CR) status and are considered moderately stable. At CR
                stage, implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.[50]
